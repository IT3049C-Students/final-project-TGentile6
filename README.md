## Self-Reflection:
This is easily one of the biggest projects I have ever worked on and definitely the biggest programming project I have invested time into. I learned a lot while making this game and feel as though I am a better more knowledgeable programmer coming out of it.
I wish I was able to further polish and clean up the code but time will not allow for it. I will settle for a fully functional and relatively bugless end product with messy code.

### How long it took me to finish this?
Around 30 hours of work.
